# PPM-TO-ASCII

Hello, I am your average computer science student doing low level things. This is my project to view ppm p3 images in command line by displaying them as ascii values. 

## USAGE

```bash
./ppm-to-ascii <file-name>
```
if no file-name is provided then it will default to csub.ppm, which then you will probably get an error or something idk. Have Fun
